# SVFFL iOS App

This was an app shared to members of a small fantasy football league via [Test Flight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/). It allowed the building of your team at the annual auction without you having to keep track of your players/remaining budget on a piece of paper.

It was developed over a couple of evenings using the now defunct [NimbleKit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw0oXnF9_xk). NimbleKit allowed the building of simple iOS apps using HTML, Javascript and CSS.

The code is here for posterity.
